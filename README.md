## Connor Neale Portfolio Goal
This project's goal was to create a sample webpage of my future portfolio. I built the contents in html. I had to go back and wrap the content in new containers multiple times for styling purposes. I used Css to style the webpage, added some hover features and tried to make the webpage as responsive as possible. I wasn't able to get it mobile responsive yet. I also added links to the rest of the page in the navbar and links to my contact information. I did not link my resume because I do not currently have an up to date copy.
